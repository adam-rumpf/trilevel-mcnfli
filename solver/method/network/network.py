"""A simple network class for use in setting up network flows problems.

The classes in this module are mostly meant as containers that can store node-
level and arc-level attributes in a convenient way for the purposes of building
objective functions and constraints for network flows functions.

This module is meant for use in storing modified network flows problems defined
in the NETGEN file format, and so most methods used for defining network
features are written under the assumption that the input file is being read
line-by-line.
