"""Computational trial driver for trilevel network interdiction game."""

# Structural plans:
# Main driver reads project files and organizes all of the things that need to
# be done with it. All of the subroutines come into play only after a specific
# trial instance has been decided on.
# Main solver is called by the driver and handles calling all of the solution
# subroutines.
# Cutting plane MILP solver.
# Cutting plane LP solver.
# Duality LP solver.

# Get a bit more of a placeholder skeleton going and then develop each solver
# on its own branch.
