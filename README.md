# Trilevel Network Interdiction Game with Linear Interdependencies

A collection of programs used to generate computational results for a research project of mine involving a trilevel network interdiction game on an interdependent network. This project is an extension of the MCNFLI project referenced [here](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/mcnfli-trials), and uses the same NETGEN code for random trial generation.
